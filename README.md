# rfm_analysis_for_a_booking_company
Here is a RFM analysis for a booking company. 

RFM, also known as RFM analysis, is a type of customer segmentation and behavioral targeting used to help businesses rank and segment customers based on the recency, frequency, and monetary value of a transaction. RFM marketing can help marketers and small business owners determine their target audience to use their budget most effectively.

Recency – How recently did the customer purchase?
Frequency – How often do they purchase?
Monetary Value – How much do they spend?

We have booking and payment tables and data in them, 

RECENCY,
What is the difference between last booking date and today for each customer. 
But today is not real today. We accept that today is last day of our data which is 27.05.2021
And we should consider only successful payments.  "ÇekimBaşarılı" means "Successful Payment"

FREQUENCY,
How many successful booking do each customer have until today. 

MONETARY,
How much total successful payment do each customer have until today. 

SCORES, 
Now we can give scores by splitting of values for each customer.  From low (1) to high (5) score. 
recency   --> from 1 to 5 / from longest difference to shortest difference 
frequency --> from 1 to 5 / from more amount to less amount
monetary  --> from 1 to 5 / from more payment to less payment

At the end of anaysis, we can see overall results on single table.
